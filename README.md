Orion's Advent of Code Solutions
### Introduction 
Hello! This is the repo of my solutions to Advent of Code. I started doing AoC in 2021. Back then, I was using MATLAB to solve all my problems. After the 2021 competition was over, I started using python, which has proven to be far more convenient for these sort of problems. I'm currently working on solutions to previous years contents (and as I'm currently writing this, it is the middle of the 2022 competition). I've only just started filling out old solutions, so there are a lot of empty folders.
